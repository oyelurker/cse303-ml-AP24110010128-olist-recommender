# Olist Pipeline Reference Notes

This is the running learning record for our project. It explains the notebook work in plain language so that each step can be revised, reproduced, and explained during a demonstration or viva.

Update this document after each completed notebook section or meaningful code block. Record actual operations and observed results. Keep future work in the planned sequence until it has been executed and checked.

## Working sequence

| Step | Work | What the notes will explain |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Project introduction and data loading | What each file contains, how it is loaded, and which variables hold it |
| 2 | Data inspection | Shapes, column types, keys, missing values, duplicates, and relationships |
| 3 | Cleaning and table preparation | Each cleaning rule, method, reason, and before-and-after effect |
| 4 | Exploratory data analysis | Each question, calculation or plot, finding, and modeling implication |
| 5 | Features, targets, and splits | Feature formulas, prediction timing, future labels, and leakage prevention |
| 6 | Model development and evaluation | Baselines, algorithms, parameters, metrics, results, and selection decisions |
| 7 | Reusable pipeline and application | Saved components, inputs, outputs, application integration, and chatbot behavior |

Recommendation and repeat-purchase prediction will have separate explanations wherever their data, models, or evaluation differ.

## Workflow for each completed section

1. State the question or purpose in a notebook Markdown cell.
2. Write a small, readable code block.
3. Run it and inspect the output.
4. Explain each meaningful line or related group of lines in the notes, including the role of important variables and methods.
5. Record the observed result and any checks, issues, or decisions.
6. Save the notebook and update these notes together.
7. Review the changes and create a focused Git commit for the completed section.

A section may contain several related cells. Commit when the section produces a verified, understandable result. Record genuine problems and fixes when they occur.

## Format for future entries

Use the following fields for each completed step or substep.

| Field | What to record |
|---|---|
| Purpose | The question or task being addressed |
| Notebook location | Notebook filename and the relevant section or cell heading |
| Inputs | Files, tables, columns, or outputs used from earlier steps |
| Code explanation | Important lines, variables, functions, parameters, and what they do |
| Method and reason | The technique used and why it fits this task |
| Observed output | Actual counts, values, plots, or model outputs from execution |
| Verification | How the output was checked |
| Decision or limitation | What we concluded and what remains uncertain |
| Commit | The descriptive commit message, with the hash once committed |

## Completed preparation

### Dataset files acquired

**Purpose** — Make the source CSVs available for the first notebook section.

**Location** — `data/raw/` at the repository root.

**Observed output** — All nine expected CSV files are present and have nonzero file sizes.

| File | Intended use |
|---|---|
| `olist_customers_dataset.csv` | Customer identity and location |
| `olist_orders_dataset.csv` | Orders and event timestamps |
| `olist_order_items_dataset.csv` | Product purchases, prices, and freight |
| `olist_order_payments_dataset.csv` | Payment records |
| `olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv` | Review scores and comments |
| `olist_products_dataset.csv` | Product categories and attributes |
| `olist_sellers_dataset.csv` | Seller identity and location |
| `olist_geolocation_dataset.csv` | Geographic coordinates by postal-code prefix |
| `product_category_name_translation.csv` | English category translations |

**Verification** — Inspected local filenames and file sizes. CSV contents, schemas, row counts, and quality checks are pending the loading and inspection sections.

### Reference notebook acquired

**Location** — `SOURCE FILES/eda-satisfaction-prediction-nlp-rfm-deployment.ipynb`.

**Purpose** — Reference for understanding data preparation, EDA, satisfaction analysis, segmentation, and deployment. Adaptations will be explained and attributed in our own notebook.

**Verification** — Confirmed that the downloaded notebook file is present and has a nonzero file size. Local execution and compatibility checks are pending.

### Reference notes established

**Purpose** — Keep a step-by-step learning record alongside the project notebook.

**Files** — `PIPELINE_NOTES.md`, with the broader scope in `PROJECT_PLAN.md` and dataset download instructions in `README.md`.

**Suggested commit message** — `docs: add pipeline learning notes and working sequence`.

**Commit status** — Pending.

## Step 1 Load the source tables

**Purpose** — Create our notebook, load the source tables, and record their dimensions.

**Notebook location** — `olist_pipeline.ipynb`, section 1 Load the source tables.

**Inputs** — The nine CSV files directly inside `data/raw/`.

### Code explanations

| Code or method | Explanation and reason |
|---|---|
| `from pathlib import Path` | Imports Python's filesystem path class. |
| `import pandas as pd` | Imports pandas under a short name for data analysis. |
| `pd.__version__` | Records the pandas version used during execution. |
| `Path.cwd()` | Finds the current working directory, which should be the repository root. |
| `project_root / "data" / "raw"` | Builds the source-folder path without a computer-specific absolute path. |
| `data_dir.is_dir()` | Checks that the source directory exists. |
| `data_files` | Maps meaningful table names to original CSV filenames. |
| `data_files.values()` | Supplies filenames for the presence check. |
| `missing_files` | Collects expected files that are absent. |
| `.is_file()` | Checks that a path points to a file. |
| `raise FileNotFoundError(...)` | Stops with an actionable message when the source folder or files are missing. |
| `postal_code_types` | Requests string storage for postal-code identifiers, preserving any leading zeros in the CSV source. |
| `tables = {}` | Creates the dictionary for the loaded DataFrames. |
| `data_files.items()` | Supplies each table name together with its filename. |
| `pd.read_csv(..., dtype=postal_code_types)` | Reads each CSV with the requested identifier types. Other types are inferred initially. |
| `tables[table_name]` | Stores and retrieves a DataFrame by its table name. |
| `summary_rows = []` | Creates a list for the summary records. |
| `tables.items()` | Supplies the loaded table names and DataFrames. |
| `dataframe.shape[0]` | Returns the row count. |
| `dataframe.shape[1]` | Returns the column count. |
| `summary_rows.append(...)` | Adds the current table's name and dimensions to the list. |
| `pd.DataFrame(summary_rows)` | Converts the summary records into a DataFrame. |
| `.to_string(index=False)` | Prints a readable table without an extra row-number column. |
| `len(tables)` | Returns the number of loaded tables. |

### Observed output

Executed using Python 3.12.14 and pandas 3.0.1.

| Table | Rows | Columns |
|---|---:|---:|
| customers | 99,441 | 5 |
| orders | 99,441 | 8 |
| order_items | 112,650 | 7 |
| order_payments | 103,886 | 5 |
| order_reviews | 99,224 | 7 |
| products | 32,951 | 9 |
| sellers | 3,095 | 4 |
| geolocation | 1,000,163 | 5 |
| category_translation | 71 | 2 |

### Verification and decisions

- Executed all three code cells in order against the actual CSV files and saved their observed outputs in the notebook.
- Confirmed nine loaded DataFrames and nonzero row and column counts.
- Confirmed string dtypes for customer, seller, and geolocation postal-code prefix columns.
- Kept the source tables separate for the upcoming key and relationship inspection.
- Timestamps remain as initially loaded. Parsing and data quality decisions will be documented later.
- Verified execution using the available Python runtime. Rerunning in VS Code requires a Python Jupyter kernel with pandas installed.

**Suggested commit message** — `feat: start Olist notebook and load source tables`.

**Commit status** — Pending.

## Next notebook section

Inspect sample rows and column types, then measure missing values and duplicate keys. Explain and verify those findings before choosing cleaning rules or combining tables.
